Phase 2:

* “Conservative” EWT, down to the stop level
    excess wait time, omitting any 'missing' buses from the analysis

    Observed/actual headway - scheduled headway, exclude calls where next bus is "missing"
    Already have A.H. and S.H., just need to find calls that are "missing"

* On-time terminal departures, at the route level
    percentage of buses in excess of three minutes behind schedule as of the third stop on each given route

* Wait assessment, down to the stop level
    calculated according to the MTA's definition for buses (something like, headways exceeding the schedule by 3 minutes or more for high frequency service; or 5 minutes or more for low frequency service)

* Stop spacing, down to the stop level
    how far apart are bus stops

* Circuitous routes, at the route level
    how indirect is the path of a given route relative to a direct (straight line) route

* Route-level EVT
    "excess in-vehicle time" (the difference between scheduled trip time and actual trip time from end-to-end of the route)
